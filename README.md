# üé® Color blend midpoints

This NPM package is  being used for generating color midpoints from 2 input colors.

## ü§î Why?

We've created this package, because we have not seen any other package that uses this approach to generate midpoints between 2 colors.

## üß∞ Installation

Node
```javascript
npm i @solcode/color-blend-midpoints
```

Yarn
```javascript
yarn add @solcode/color-blend-midpoints
```

# üé¨ Introduction & Usage

This package exports 2 primary features.
- **ColorBlender** class that is responsible for generating midpoints
- **blendColors** (initialColor: string, targetColor: string, midpoints: number), this method simply wraps up the ColorBlender class in order to get the blends in one line
- **hexToRgb** & **rgbToHex** helper methods


### How to get a blends?

```typescript
import { blendColors } from "color-blend-midpoints"

const blends = blendColors('#000000', '#FFFFFF', 6)

// generates 6 midpoints between these 2 colors ‚¨áÔ∏è
// ['#000000','#242424','#494949','#6D6D6D','#929292','#B6B6B6','#DBDBDB','#FFFFFF']
```
